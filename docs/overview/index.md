## What is Mycel?

Mycel is an innovative identity infrastructure designed to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 technologies. It's a platform that simplifies the integration and management of digital identities, allowing for seamless interaction between traditional web applications and the decentralized web. Mycel achieves this by enabling the creation of Web3 IDs from existing Web2 IDs, such as those from Google or Apple, and facilitating the linkage of these Web3 IDs (DIDs or Wallets) with existing Web2 applications.
