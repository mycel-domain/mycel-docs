# Introduction

## What is Mycel?

Mycel is a decentralized platform that enables the transfer, management, and trading of various accounts across different blockchain platforms. It allows users to create a "Transferable Account" that combines their own account with a threshold signature scheme (TSS) signed by Mycel chain validators.

This transferable account serves as a gateway for interacting with native assets on both Ethereum-based account-based chains (e.g., ERC-20 tokens) and Bitcoin-based UTXO-based chains (e.g., BTC). By creating this account, users can:

- Exchange assets across different blockchain platforms
- Buy and sell accounts tied to specific activities

Mycel's decentralized architecture ensures that no single party has control over the transferable account or the assets within it, maintaining the security and integrity of the users' assets.
