# Introduction

## What is Mycel?

Mycel is an intent-centric interface to solve complexity in multi-chain and bring bilion users for Web3 by eliminating the need for them to understand complex blockchain concepts like gas fees and transactions.

By adopting Mycel's intent-centric interface, protocols like Restaking Protocols and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) can provide a user-friendly experience, where actions are reduced to simple intents that hide the complex details of blockchain operations.
This approach enables a broader range of applications to become more user-friendly, inviting a vast new audience to explore.

## What is Intent?

In the context of software and blockchain technologies, an "intent" refers to a user's declared goal or desired outcome without specifying the procedural steps needed to achieve that outcome. It's a high-level declaration of what the user wants to do, such as sending tokens to someone, purchasing an item, or accessing a service. The concept of intent abstracts away the complexity of the operations required to fulfill these desires, focusing instead on the end result that the user wants to achieve.

For exmaple,
Intent: "I want to send 5 ETH to Alice."

- Traditional Method: The user would need to manually initiate a transaction, enter Alice's wallet address, specify the amount (5 ETH), set the gas fee, and sign the transaction.
- Intent-Centric Approach: The user simply declares the intent to send 5 ETH to Alice, and the platform automatically handles the details, such as finding Alice's wallet address and executing the transaction.

## What is an Intent-Centric Interface?

An intent-centric interface, as exemplified by Mycel, is a design paradigm that prioritizes these user intents in the interaction model. Instead of requiring users to understand and navigate the complex processes underlying their actions (such as blockchain transactions), an intent-centric interface allows users to simply state their "intent" and relies on the system to figure out how to execute it. This approach significantly simplifies the user experience, making technology like blockchain more accessible and user-friendly.
How Mycel Implements an Intent-Centric Interface

Mycel leverages the intent-centric model to enhance interactions within the blockchain ecosystem, particularly focusing on identity and transaction management. Here’s how Mycel embodies this approach:

- Simplified Digital Identity: Users can manage their digital identities across Web2 and Web3 platforms without delving into technical details. By expressing the intent to, for example, link a Web2 identity with a Web3 wallet, Mycel automates the underlying processes.

- ID-Based Transactions: Mycel allows users to perform transactions using domain names instead of complex blockchain addresses. Users express an intent like “send tokens to domain.name,” and Mycel handles the resolution and execution of these transactions, abstracting away the technicalities.

- Multi-Chain Operations: By supporting intents that span across multiple blockchains, Mycel facilitates a seamless experience for users wanting to interact with different blockchain ecosystems without worrying about the specifics of each chain.
