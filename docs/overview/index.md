# Introduction

## What is mycel?

mycel is a decentralized name service that can resolve domains and wallet addresses.
mycel supports name resolution in DNS, IBC, and smart contracts on supported chains.  
It is also integrated with other blockchain name services such as [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains).
For example, by connecting your ENS domain to mycel, you can resolve your ENS domain (not only Ethereum addresses, but also Bitcoin, Cosmos, Aptos, and more) from other supported chains, or resolve your website by adding DNS records.
