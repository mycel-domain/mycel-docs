# Introduction

## What is Mycel?

Mycel is an innovative identity infrastructure designed to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 technologies. It's a platform that simplifies the integration and management of digital identities, allowing for seamless interaction between traditional web applications and the decentralized web. Mycel achieves this by enabling the creation of Web3 IDs from existing Web2 IDs, such as those from Google or Apple, and facilitating the linkage of these Web3 IDs (DIDs or Wallets) with existing Web2 applications.

### Mycel ID

Mycel ID is at the heart of the Mycel infrastructure, serving as a unique digital identifier in the Web3 world.
It enables users to register and manage their Web3 identities effortlessly, merging the convenience of Web2 identity systems with the security and decentralization of Web3.
Mycel ID supports various authentication methods, including biometric (fingerprint) and traditional methods (Google, Email, etc.), ensuring that users have a smooth transition to and interaction within the Web3 space. With its integration of off-chain and on-chain elements and native DNS support, Mycel ID lays the foundation for a decentralized, yet user-friendly platform that harmonizes the best aspects of Web2 and Web3 technologies.

### Domain-based Transfer

The Domain-based Transfer feature of Mycel revolutionizes how tokens are transacted in the Web3 space. This feature allows users to send and receive tokens using just domain names, significantly enhancing privacy by keeping actual wallet addresses confidential.
The intent-based sequencer incorporated into Mycel's Domain-based Transfer system improves the efficiency and security of transactions. This innovation not only simplifies the transaction process but also enriches the user experience, making Web3 more accessible and user-friendly.
With multi-chain support, users can perform transactions across various blockchain networks, showcasing the flexibility and interoperability of Mycel.

### Authentication Provider

Mycel's Authentication Provider feature acts as a bridge, bringing familiar Web2-style authentication to the Web3 environment. Leveraging well-established protocols like OAuth and Active Directory, Mycel enables users to access Web3 applications using their existing Web2 accounts.
This seamless transition plays a critical role in breaking down the barriers to Web3 adoption, ensuring that users can interact with decentralized applications with the same ease as traditional ones. The Authentication Provider is central to enhancing user accessibility and security in the Web3 space, fostering a more inclusive and interconnected digital ecosystem.
