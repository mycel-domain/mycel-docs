# Presale

## Exclusive Access to Premium Domain Names

The mycel domain name presale offers early adopters the opportunity to secure premium domain names before they become available to the general public. This exclusive access allows participants to register short, memorable, and high-value domain names, increasing their potential for future growth and success in the decentralized ecosystem.

mycel domain names in the presale are represented as NFTs on the Ethereum network. This innovative approach adds an additional layer of value to the domain names, as they can be traded, sold, or transferred easily on various NFT marketplaces. NFTs also ensure the uniqueness and ownership of the domain names, providing a verifiable and secure record of each domain.

## Migration to mycel

After the presale, NFT holders will be able to migrate their purchased domain names to the mycel platform. The migration process will involve the following steps:

1. Lock NFT on Ethereum  
   The NFT holder will lock their NFT on the Ethereum network. Locking the NFT prevents any further transfers or sales of the NFT on Ethereum, effectively securing the domain name for migration to the mycel platform.

2. Register Domain on mycel  
   Once the NFT is locked on Ethereum, the NFT holder can register the corresponding domain name on the mycel platform.
   The mycel platform will verify the locked status of the NFT on Ethereum and, if valid, register the domain name to the NFT holder's Kepler wallet address to edit records.
