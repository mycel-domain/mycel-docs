# Concepts

The key concepts of Mycel revolve around its innovative approach to managing and interacting with blockchain state machines. These concepts lay the foundation for how Mycel enables seamless cross-chain interactions, secure asset management, and programmable functionality that can be tailored to specific use cases.

## Transferable Accounts

At the heart of Mycelâ€™s infrastructure is the Transferable Account. A Transferable Account is a novel digital entity that allows users to securely manage, transfer, and trade assets across various blockchain platforms. Unlike traditional accounts, which are often tied to a single blockchain and operate within its constraints, Transferable Accounts are designed to be fluid, moving freely between different chains while maintaining the integrity and security of the assets they hold.

### Key Features of Transferable Accounts:

- Cross-Chain Mobility: Transferable Accounts can be transferred or exchanged on any compatible blockchain or state machine. This mobility is essential for users who need to operate across multiple networks, as it eliminates the need to rely on centralized exchanges or complex bridging solutions.
- Security: The security of Transferable Accounts is ensured through the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and advanced cryptographic techniques. The private keys associated with these accounts are generated and stored within a TEE, ensuring that they are never exposed to the outside world.

Transferable Accounts serve as the fundamental building block of Mycel, enabling the seamless flow of assets and data across diverse blockchain ecosystems. They provide a secure and flexible mechanism for managing digital assets in a decentralized world, breaking down the barriers between different blockchains and making cross-chain interactions more accessible and efficient.

## Programmable Accounts

Building on the foundation of Transferable Accounts, Mycel introduces the concept of Programmable Accounts. Programmable Accounts represent a significant evolution in how users can interact with and control their blockchain assets. Unlike Transferable Accounts, which operate under predefined rules, Programmable Accounts allow users to define and customize the conditions under which their assets can be signed, transferred, or interacted with.

### Key Features of Programmable Accounts:

- Customizable Logic: Programmable Accounts enable users to embed custom logic and conditions directly into their accounts. This logic can include a wide range of programmable conditions, such as multi-signature requirements, time delays, or triggers based on external data (e.g., price feeds from oracles). This allows users to create highly tailored solutions for asset management, automated trading, and other complex workflows.
- Security and Control: By allowing conditions to be programmed into the account itself, users gain greater control over their assets. For example, a user might program their account to require authorization from multiple parties before a transfer can occur, or to restrict transfers to specific time periods. These features enhance the security and usability of the account, making it adaptable to various scenarios.
- Interoperability with Smart Contracts: Programmable Accounts can interact seamlessly with smart contracts and dApps across different blockchain networks. This interoperability enables more sophisticated use cases, such as conditional payments, decentralized governance, and automated compliance, all of which can be managed directly from the account level.

Programmable Accounts open up new possibilities for users, allowing them to manage their assets with a level of precision and customization that was previously unattainable. Whether for complex financial contracts, decentralized governance, or secure asset transfers, Programmable Accounts provide the tools necessary to create bespoke solutions that fit any use case.
