# Authentication Provider

Mycel's Authentication Provider feature acts as a bridge, bringing familiar Web2-style authentication to the Web3 environment. Leveraging well-established protocols like OAuth and Active Directory, Mycel enables users to access Web3 applications using their existing Web2 accounts.
This seamless transition plays a critical role in breaking down the barriers to Web3 adoption, ensuring that users can interact with decentralized applications with the same ease as traditional ones. The Authentication Provider is central to enhancing user accessibility and security in the Web3 space, fostering a more inclusive and interconnected digital ecosystem.
