# Incentives

Mycel is driven by the belief that:

- Domain registration fees should be dedicated to domain management expenses.
- Interoperable domains should be managed not by a single governance entity but by a governance structure formed by the network that manages the domains.

## Distribution to Validators and Delegators

The Mycel platform aims to create a decentralized and fair ecosystem for domain name registration and management.
The domain registration fees collected during each period are distributed among validators and delegators as a form of reward for their contributions to the Mycel network.
This incentives network participants to actively engage in maintaining the security and stability of the platform.

## Fee Distribution Process

At the end of each distribution period, the accumulated domain registration fees will be distributed among validators and delegators based on their respective stakes and contributions to the network.
The distribution period is a predefined time interval during which the domain registration fees are accumulated.

The distribution process consists of the following steps:

1. Calculate the total domain registration fees collected during the distribution period.
2. Determine the individual share for validators based on their staked tokens.
3. Distribute the shares to each validators.
4. Calculate the rewards for delegators based on their delegated tokens.
5. Distribute the rewards to each delegator.
