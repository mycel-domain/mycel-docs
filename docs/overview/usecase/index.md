# Usecase

## Cross-Chain Swap and Bridge without Native Tokens

This use case is particularly appealing in the context of the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, where users often need to interact with multiple blockchain networks, each requiring its native token for transaction fees. Mycel simplifies this process, enhancing user experience and accessibility.

## ID based Cross-chain Transfer

Currently almost transactions in crypto are “Address based Transfer” but Mycel propose new style with Intent Centric Design, “ID based transfer”. Mycel ID holder can recieve any tokens on any blockchains if the person who want to send a token for Mycel ID holder.
