# Usecase

## Cross-Chain Transactions

Cross-chain transactions, or the process of transferring assets between different blockchain networks, traditionally involve complex steps and a deep understanding of the intricacies of each network involved. Mycel significantly simplifies this process through its intent-centric approach and ID-based transfers.

## Interoperable Gaming and SocialFi

The gaming industry and social finance (SocialFi) are rapidly evolving with the integration of blockchain technology, introducing concepts like play-to-earn (P2E) and decentralized social networks. However, interoperability between different blockchain networks remains a challenge, often limiting the seamless exchange of assets and social interactions across platforms. Mycel's infrastructure aims to bridge these gaps, providing a unified experience.
