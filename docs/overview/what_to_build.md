# What to Build

## Decentralized OTC Market

Design a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) market for transferring transferable accounts. This will allow buyers and sellers to interact directly without the need for intermediaries.

## Intents

Develop a system for recording intentions to buy or sell transferable accounts. This will enable parties to express their willingness to transact at specific prices or quantities.

## Cross-domain MEV

## Account Activity Market Place

Design an account activity market place where buyers and sellers can interact directly to buy, sell, or trade transferable accounts. This will enable parties to discover new trading opportunities and negotiate prices in a decentralized manner.
