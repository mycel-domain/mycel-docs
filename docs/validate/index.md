# Introduction

Validators are nodes that participate in the security of a network and are responsible for committing new blocks in the blockchain.

## Validator

Validators constitute a pivotal part of Mycel, with numerous advantages and incentives being provided. In the following, we elucidate how validators procure rewards, the incentives in place for maintaining network security and stability, the specific role validators play within the network, and the impact thereof on the token economics.

### Rewards and Incentives:

1. Earning Rewards: Validators are rewarded with MYCEL tokens for committing new blocks and storing data, the reward being calculated as a specified percentage of the total stake. Additionally, they receive transaction fees as rewards for processing transactions.
2. Governance: Validators engage in discussions regarding network rules and policies, participate in voting, and collaboratively shape the network's governance with the community. As token holders, validators vote on governance proposals, collectively determining the network's direction. The token economics facilitates incentives to validators through allocation of voting rights and a reward system, thereby enhancing the network's safety and efficiency. This structure motivates validators to maintain the network's integrity and to actively engage in the governance process.

## Delegator

By delegating tokens to validators, delegators augment network governance and security, and in turn, earn rewards. However, this process encompasses risks, necessitating prudent selection and management of validator delegation.

### Rewards and Risks:

1. Rewards: Validators authenticate blocks and allocate a portion of their rewards to delegators. The rewards for delegators are proportional to the amount of tokens delegated, enabling delegators to receive regular staking rewards through delegation.
2. Risks: The selection of a validator is pivotal as voting for dishonest validators could incur penalties. In instances where delegators vote for a validator exhibiting dishonest behavior, they could face penalties and potentially lose their delegated tokens. It is imperative to choose efficient and trustworthy validators to minimize risks and maximize rewards. Delegators bear the responsibility of meticulously selecting validators, which in turn enhances network governance and security, with their choice of validator directly impacting their rewards and risks.
