# Modules

Mycel implements the following modules:

- [epochs](/develop/modules/epochs): Makes on-chain timers which other modules can execute code during.
- [registry](/develop/modules/registry): Manages domain records and registrations.
- [resolver](/develop/modules/resolver): Resolves domain name.
